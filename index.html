        Oromo Leadership Program is a non profit organization that desires to improve relationships in our Oromo
        community in Minnesota. All of our founders have always dreamt of somehow giving back to the community that
        created who we are today, so this is our way of returning the favor.

        ​I am a senior at Tartan High School in Oakdale, Minnesota. I am involved in many things at school including
        DECA, Student Council, National Honors Society, and Relay for Life programs. I’ve always had a passion for
        business and in my free time you can find my reading up on business ethics. I enjoy playing recreational
        basketball with my friends, but also spending time with my family and discovering new things. I started OLP
        because I noticed a significant disconnect in our youth and a need of unity in the community. In my future, I
        plan on studying marketing information systems, but also minor in humanities and help my oromo community back
        home. In fifteen years, I see myself as a successful informations system manager and making a change in Oromia.

          Youth volunteer, and I also volunteer at Fairview Ridges Hospitals. During my free time I enjoy cooking and
          read and watch medical shows and articles. I love spending time with my loved ones. I love to organize and
          decorate for parties. I started OLP in the hopes to inspire the youth to explore new things, to be who they
          want, be the best at anything they love to do, and to love their roots. I want the community to support each
          other and be there for each other. I plan on studying

          <div id="small"> I am a senior at Breck School in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I play basketball for my school, and
            I also participate in Breck’s Advanced History Research Program. I am currently studying at the School for
            Ethics and Global Leadership in Washington D.C. In D.C., I’m learning about how I can become a more ethical
            leader. I’m also learning about the ins and outs of the United States’ political system. I enjoy writing
            poems and playing basketball when I’m free. I started OLP because I wanted to do my part in inspiring young
            Oromo boys and girls to be proud of their Oromo identities. Throughout high school I haven’t had many
            opportunities to connect with other Oromo students. I plan on studying political science in college. In
            fifteen years, I see myself as an immigration and criminal justice lawyer. ​

            I am a senior at Champlin Park High School in Champlain, Minnesota. I play football for Champlin Park for
            two years and am very committed to the team. I’ve always been deeply interested in the engineering field and
            often try to keep up with new advancements in the technological world. I plan on studying mechanical or
            electrical engineering. I started OLP because I am a firm believer in giving back to where you came from.
            I’ve seen so many first generation Americans not knowing what to do or how to prepare themselves for school
            in america because of lack of guidance. I myself have struggled with how to go about bettering myself in a
            school environment and wish to build a wide spanning network of connections for young Oromos to build
            themselves up and become leaders in our community.

            soccer for Blaine Soccer Club, am a member of Irondale’s Science Olympiad team and Math Team, and also part
            of the National Honors Society. For fun I learn as much as possible about computer science and spend time
            with family and friends. I started OLP because I have seen many Oromo teenagers start going down the wrong
            path in life, so I wanted to help them get their lives back on track and inspire them to become the best
            that they could possibly be. I will be attending Stanford Summer Session during the summer of 2019, so there
            I will be studying Computer Science and I will also do the same during college. In 15 years I see myself
            working somewhere in the field of computer science.
